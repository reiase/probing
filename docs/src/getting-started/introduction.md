# Introduction

Welcome to **Probing** - a dynamic performance profiler and stability diagnostic tool designed specifically for AI applications. Probing addresses the unique challenges of debugging and optimizing large-scale, distributed, long-running AI workloads such as LLM training and inference.

## What is Probing?

Probing is a runtime analysis tool that injects probes into running Python processes to collect detailed performance data and enable real-time monitoring without requiring code modifications or process restarts. Think of it as a powerful magnifying glass for your AI applications that reveals exactly what's happening under the hood.

## Core Principles

Probing is built on three fundamental principles:

### üîç **Zero Intrusion**
- No code modifications required
- No environment setup changes needed
- No workflow disruptions
- Dynamic probe injection into running processes

### üéØ **Zero Learning Curve** 
- Standard SQL interface for data analysis
- Familiar database query patterns
- Intuitive command-line tools
- Web-based dashboard for visualization

### üì¶ **Zero Deployment Burden**
- Single binary deployment (Rust-based)
- Static compilation with minimal dependencies
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Elastic scaling capabilities

## Key Features

### üéØ **Live Code Execution (`eval`)**
- **Arbitrary Python Code**: Run any Python code inside your target process
- **Real-time State Inspection**: Check variables, objects, and system state instantly  
- **Dynamic Behavior Modification**: Change configuration, clear caches, or trigger actions
- **Custom Metrics Collection**: Gather any data your application can compute

### üìä **SQL-Based Analytics (`query`)**
- **Structured Performance Data**: Query PyTorch traces, call stacks, and system metrics
- **Familiar SQL Interface**: Use standard SQL syntax with powerful time-series functions
- **Real Tables, Real Data**: Query actual collected data, not synthetic examples
- **Cross-correlation Analysis**: Understand relationships between performance metrics

### üîç **Deep Stack Analysis (`backtrace`)**
- **Real-time Call Stack Capture**: Get live execution context with variable values from the main thread
- **Python Variable Inspection**: See current local variables, function arguments, and object state
- **Live Stack Analysis**: Query current execution state of the main thread
- **Main Thread Focus**: Analyze the primary execution path and main thread activity

### üöÄ **Production-Ready Foundation**
- **Zero-Intrusion Injection**: Attach to running processes without code changes
- **Minimal Performance Impact**: < 5% overhead in most real-world scenarios
- **Cross-Platform Support**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **Distributed System Ready**: Monitor processes across multiple machines

## Three Core Capabilities

Probing provides three powerful capabilities that work together to give you complete insight into your running applications:

> **üìù Note**: All examples below use `$ENDPOINT` to represent your target process. Set this to your process ID (e.g., `export ENDPOINT=12345`) or remote address (e.g., `export ENDPOINT=host:port`). See the [Quick Start](#quick-start-your-first-5-minutes) section for detailed setup instructions.

### üéØ **eval**: Execute Code in Live Processes
Run arbitrary Python code directly inside your target process to inspect state, modify behavior, or gather custom metrics.

```bash
# Check training threads
probing $ENDPOINT eval "import threading; [print(f'{t.name}: {t.is_alive()}') for t in threading.enumerate()]"
# Expected output:
# MainThread: True
# Thread-1 (train_worker): True
# Thread-2 (data_loader): True

# Check GPU memory usage
probing $ENDPOINT eval "import torch; print(f'GPU: {torch.cuda.memory_allocated()/1024**3:.1f}GB allocated, {torch.cuda.memory_reserved()/1024**3:.1f}GB cached') if torch.cuda.is_available() else print('CUDA unavailable')"
# Expected output (with GPU):
# GPU: 2.4GB allocated, 3.2GB cached
# Expected output (without GPU):
# CUDA unavailable
```

### üìä **query**: Analyze Data with SQL
Query structured performance data using familiar SQL syntax to identify patterns, bottlenecks, and trends.

```bash
# Analyze PyTorch training patterns
probing $ENDPOINT query "
SELECT 
    step,
    module,
    SUM(allocated) as total_memory_mb,
    COUNT(*) as operation_count
FROM python.torch_trace 
WHERE step > 100 
GROUP BY step, module 
ORDER BY total_memory_mb DESC 
LIMIT 10"
# Expected output:
# step  | module           | total_memory_mb | operation_count
# ------|------------------|-----------------|----------------
# 150   | transformer.attn | 2048.5         | 24
# 149   | transformer.attn | 2047.8         | 24  
# 151   | transformer.mlp  | 1536.2         | 16
# 150   | transformer.mlp  | 1535.9         | 16
# ...
```

### üîç **backtrace**: Debug with Stack Context
Capture detailed call stacks with Python variable values to understand exactly what your main thread is doing at any moment.

```bash
# Capture current call stack from the main thread
probing $ENDPOINT backtrace

# Query the live main thread stack trace with variable inspection
probing $ENDPOINT query "SELECT func, file, lineno FROM python.backtrace ORDER BY depth LIMIT 3"
# Expected output:
# func           | file                  | lineno
# ---------------|-----------------------|--------
# forward_pass   | /app/training_loop.py | 89
# transformer    | /app/model.py         | 245
# multi_head_attn| /app/attention.py     | 156

# The python.backtrace table shows main thread execution context:
# - func: function name
# - file: source file path  
# - lineno: line number
# - depth: call stack depth (0 = deepest frame)
```

## Real-World Debugging Scenarios

Now that you understand the three core capabilities, let's see how they work together to solve common AI/ML debugging challenges:

### Scenario 1: Training Process Hanging
**Problem**: PyTorch training suddenly stops progressing.  
**Solution**: Use the three capabilities in sequence:

```bash
# 1. BACKTRACE: See what main thread is doing right now
probing $ENDPOINT backtrace

# 2. EVAL: Check broader system state  
probing $ENDPOINT eval "import threading; [(t.name, t.is_alive(), t.daemon) for t in threading.enumerate()]"
# Expected output:
# [('MainThread', True, False), ('Thread-1', False, False), ('Thread-2', True, True)]

# 3. QUERY: Analyze the captured stack context
probing $ENDPOINT query "SELECT func, file, lineno, depth FROM python.backtrace ORDER BY depth LIMIT 10"
# Expected output: (shows top 10 stack frames)
# func         | file              | lineno | depth
# -------------|-------------------|--------|-------
# wait_for_data| /app/dataloader.py| 234    | 0
# get_batch    | /app/training.py  | 89     | 1  
# train_step   | /app/main.py      | 156    | 2
# ... (up to 10 frames total)
```

### Scenario 2: Memory Leak Investigation  
**Problem**: Memory usage keeps growing during training.  
**Solution**: Monitor, analyze, then correlate:

```bash
# EVAL: Force cleanup and get current state
probing $ENDPOINT eval "import gc, torch; gc.collect(); torch.cuda.empty_cache() if torch.cuda.is_available() else None; print('Cleanup complete')"
# Expected output:
# Cleanup complete

# QUERY: Analyze allocation trends over recent training steps
probing $ENDPOINT query "SELECT step, AVG(allocated) as avg_memory, MAX(allocated) as peak_memory FROM python.torch_trace WHERE step >= (SELECT MAX(step) - 20 FROM python.torch_trace) GROUP BY step ORDER BY step"
# Expected output:
# step | avg_memory | peak_memory
# -----|------------|-------------
# 980  | 1024.5     | 1156.8
# 981  | 1026.2     | 1158.9  
# 982  | 1028.7     | 1161.4   # ‚Üê Memory growing!
# 983  | 1031.1     | 1164.2
# ...
```

### Scenario 3: Performance Bottleneck Analysis
**Problem**: Need to identify which model components are slowest.  
**Solution**: Real-time profiling with contextual analysis:

```bash
# BACKTRACE: Capture execution state during slow periods
probing $ENDPOINT backtrace

# QUERY: Find most expensive operations across recent steps  
probing $ENDPOINT query "SELECT module, stage, AVG(allocated) as avg_memory, COUNT(*) as frequency FROM python.torch_trace WHERE step >= (SELECT MAX(step) - 5 FROM python.torch_trace) GROUP BY module, stage ORDER BY avg_memory DESC LIMIT 10"
# Expected output:
# module                | stage    | avg_memory | frequency
# ---------------------|----------|------------|----------
# transformer.self_attn| forward  | 2048.7     | 25
# transformer.mlp      | forward  | 1536.4     | 20
# embedding_layer      | forward  | 512.8      | 15
# layer_norm           | forward  | 64.2       | 40
# ...

# EVAL: Get real-time system metrics for correlation
probing $ENDPOINT eval "import psutil; proc = psutil.Process(); print(f'CPU: {proc.cpu_percent():.1f}%, Memory: {proc.memory_info().rss/1024**3:.2f}GB, Threads: {proc.num_threads()}')"
# Expected output:
# CPU: 85.3%, Memory: 12.45GB, Threads: 8

## Quick Start: Your First 5 Minutes

Get immediate value from Probing with this streamlined workflow:

### Step 1: Set Your Target Process

All Probing commands need a target endpoint. Set `$ENDPOINT` to either a local process ID or remote address:

```bash
# Local process - find and set your Python process ID
export ENDPOINT=$(pgrep -f "python.*your_script")
# Expected result: ENDPOINT now contains your process ID (e.g., 12345)

# Or for remote processes
export ENDPOINT=remote-host:8080
# Expected result: ENDPOINT set to remote address
```

> **üí° Need help finding processes?** Use `ps aux | grep python` or `pgrep -f "python.*train"` to locate your target.

### Step 2: Connect and Explore (30 seconds)

```bash
# Connect to your process
probing $ENDPOINT inject
# Expected output:
# Successfully injected probes into process 12345

# Get basic process info
probing $ENDPOINT eval "import os, psutil; proc = psutil.Process(); print(f'PID: {os.getpid()}, Memory: {proc.memory_info().rss/1024**2:.1f}MB')"
# Expected output:
# PID: 12345, Memory: 1250.4MB
```

### Step 3: Try All Three Core Capabilities (2 minutes)

**üìä Query structured data:**
```bash
probing $ENDPOINT query "SELECT name, value FROM information_schema.df_settings LIMIT 5"
# Expected output:
# name                    | value
# ------------------------|--------
# max_threads             | 8
# memory_pool_size        | 2048
# cache_enabled           | true
# debug_mode              | false
# profiling_interval      | 100
```

**üéØ Execute live code:**
```bash
probing $ENDPOINT eval "import torch; print(f'CUDA: {torch.cuda.is_available()}') if 'torch' in globals() else print('PyTorch not loaded')"
# Expected output (with PyTorch):
# CUDA: True
# Expected output (without PyTorch):
# PyTorch not loaded
```

**üîç Capture execution context:**
```bash
probing $ENDPOINT backtrace

probing $ENDPOINT query "SELECT func, file, lineno FROM python.backtrace ORDER BY depth LIMIT 5"
# Expected output:
# func           | file                  | lineno
# ---------------|-----------------------|--------
# forward        | /app/model.py         | 89

# 1. Capture current state
probing $ENDPOINT backtrace

# 2. Check what's happening now
probing $ENDPOINT eval "import threading; print('Active threads:', len(threading.enumerate()))"
# Expected output:
# Active threads: 5

# 3. Analyze the results
probing $ENDPOINT query "SELECT func, file, lineno FROM python.backtrace ORDER BY depth"
# Expected output:
# func                | file                    | lineno
# --------------------|-------------------------|--------
# compute_loss        | /app/loss.py           | 45
