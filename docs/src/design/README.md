# Design Overview

## Why Python Dominates AI: The Pythonic Advantage

Python's dominance in AI stems from one core principle: **everything feels like Python**. Whether you're using pandas, PyTorch, or NumPy, you can **talk to them pythonic**—the same `print()`, iteration, and attribute access patterns work everywhere. Interactive environments like REPL and Jupyter notebooks further reinforce this seamless development experience.


## How Distributed Systems Break the Pythonic Experience

As AI models scale to distributed clusters, something fundamental breaks: **distributed systems aren't Pythonic**. Single-machine debugging feels natural—`print(model.parameters())`, `loss.item()`, `torch.cuda.memory_allocated()`—but distributed debugging forces you into system administration tools: `kubectl get nodes`, SSH sessions, log file parsing, monitoring dashboards. You lose the interactive, consistent, composable experience that makes Python powerful.


## Probing: Restoring the Pythonic Experience for Distributed Systems

Probing's core mission is simple: **make distributed systems feel Pythonic again**. Your cluster, nodes, and distributed processes become Python objects with familiar interfaces—`len(cluster.nodes)`, `node.gpu_usage`, `cluster.training.status`. Interactive exploration, consistent patterns, and natural composition return to distributed debugging. Instead of context-switching between tools, you stay in Python and **talk to your distributed system pythonic**.
